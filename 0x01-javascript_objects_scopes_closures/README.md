# PROJECT: 0x01. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures
### AUTHOR: Matthew Allen

## TASKS:
### 0. Rectangle #0 - `0-rectangle.js`
Empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.

### 1. Rectangle #1 - `1-rectangle.js`
Class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle (similar to #0), including a constructor that takes two arguments, `w` and `h` which initialize instance attributes `width` and `height`, respectively.

### 2. Rectangle #2 - `2-rectangle.js`
Class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle (similar to #1) that creates an empty objects if either `w` or `h` are <= 0.

### 3. Rectangle #3 - `3-rectangle.js`
Class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle (similar to #2), with the instance method `print()` that prints a rectangle using the character `X`.

### 4. Rectangle #4 - `4-rectangle.js`
Class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle (similar to #3), with the instance method `rotate()` that exchanges the `width` and the `height` of the rectangle, and the instance method `double()` that multiplies the `width` and the `height` of the rectangle by 2.

### 5. Square #0 - `5-square.js`
Class `Square` that defines a square and inherits from `Rectangle` of `4-rectangle.js`.

### 6. Square #1 - `6-square.js`
Class `Square` that defines a square (similar to #0), with an instance method `charPrint(c)` that prints the rectangle using the character `c` (using the character `X` if `c` is undefined).

### 7. Occurrences - `7-occurrences.js`
Function that returns the number of occurences in a list.

### 8. Esrever - `8-esrever.js`
Function that returns the reversed version of a list.

### 9. Log me - `9-logme.js`
Function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value, with the following format: `<number arguments already printed>: <current argument value>`.

### 10. Number conversion - `10-converter.js`
Function that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as argument.
